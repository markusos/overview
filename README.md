OverView, a project management tool for Basecamp. OverView provides a quick and clear summary of all active tasks for each team member across all Basecamp projects.

The interface is simple and clean; it is designed to make it easy for project managers to quickly organize team members and arrange them in an order that is most beneficial to them.

OverView makes it possible to efficiently see upcoming deadlines and makes it easy to follow up on a projectâ€™s progress. Under each team member, tasks can be sorted by project name or by date.

##Setup

Clone the repository:
`` $ git clone git@github.com:EngageDC/overview.git``

Open the project directory and run composer install:
`` $ cd overview && composer install ``

If you have Vagrant installed, you can run ``vagrant up`` to instantiate a virtuall machine to try out OverView.

To setup your own version of OverView you need to register an app at [integrate.37signals.com](https://integrate.37signals.com) and update the file ``app/config/basecamp.php`` with your client id and client secret.

```php
 return array(
    'clientId'      => 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE',
    'clientSecret'  => 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE',
    'userAgent'     => 'Overview (your_email_here@company.com)',
);
```

OverView does not store any information, it is just processing the to-do lists from the Basecamp API and presenting them to the user.
